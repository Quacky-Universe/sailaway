# SailAway (Working Title):

> Sailaway is a game worked on by the members of **Quacky Studios**. It is a title taking place in vast oceans of islands, where you explore it as a sailing ship. You can sail through the vast oceans finding various island biomes, fighting other pirate ships, searching for treasure, or you can just turn on peaceful mode and relax while you explore the ocean, in an aesthetic atmosphere, simultaneously hearing to calming music.
